I started with this project because I was working on some X.509 code and needed to DER encode some ASN.1 objects. I wanted to learn more about it so I coded my own implementation.

I have tested this with a higher level X.509 library and it seems to work fine. It's not necessarily the most optimal code but that gives you something to do ðŸ˜‰

Please feel free to use it, offer feedback, extend it, whatever.
